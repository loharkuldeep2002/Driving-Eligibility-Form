This project is a simple web application that determines if a person is eligible to drive based on their age. It is built using HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to provide a clean and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Age Validation**: Checks if the entered age is valid.
- **Eligibility Check**: Determines if the user is eligible to drive based on the age provided.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Simple and clean design to ensure ease of use.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Age**: The user is prompted to enter their age.
2. **Validation**: The application checks if the entered age is valid.
   - If the age is less than 0, it prompts the user to "Enter the perfect age".
   - If the age is below 18, it displays "Not Eligible to Drive".
   - If the age is 18 or above, it displays "You are Eligible to Drive".
